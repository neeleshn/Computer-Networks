High Level Approach:
- Extracted NUID and Password by reading arguments from command line.
- Created a Set for Unique URLs and a Queue to add all URLs to be parsed.
- Created a payload with username password and csrftoken to login into fakebook.
- Handled wrong username and password by searching for the wrong username password message in the page.
- Parsed the homepage, extracted URLs and all the new URLs were added into the set and queue.
- As soon as we get a URL we check if exists in the Unique URLs set, if not then we add it into the set and the queue.
- A URL existing in the set means it has been parsed before.
- Iterated through the queue, parsed the page, extracted more URLs and added those URLs to the Queue and set only they were not parsed before.
- While parsing the page we also check if there are any flags in the flags in the page. We stop as soon as we reach the count of 5 flags.
- Handled 500 response code by iterating until it becomes 200.
- Handled 40X response code by continuing with other URLs
- 30X response code is handled by python by redirecting automatically


Challenges:
- Faced some trouble during login session and we did not know about csrftoken intially.


Testing Code:
Tested code using different scenaraios.
- Tested without username and password.
- Tested improper systax of running the program.
- Tested improper username and password
- Handled all status codes. Iterated until status code 500 turns to 200.
- Handled all network issues like unable to create sessions etc.
