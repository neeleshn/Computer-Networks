High Level Approach:
- We started code by creating method to read arguments from command line and extracted the hostname and NUID. 
- Created different methods, one for regualar socket connection and other for SSL socket.
- With port number , hostname from arguments created socket and sent the message to server.
- Ran the loop until we received the BYE message from server and printed the flag.

Challenges:
We have not faced any challenges

Testing Code:
Tested code using different scenaraios.
- Verified whether it returned Unknown_Husky_ID where it did not recognize the husky id.
- Made sure that the message from servers are valid and can the expressions can be solved.
- Handled all possible exceptions like if user did not enter port number after -p, hostname or neu id etc
